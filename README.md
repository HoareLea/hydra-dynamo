[Hydra](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/) is a web platform to share your example files from Grasshopper and Dynamo.

Hydra is started at the [2015 AEC TECH Hackathon](http://aec-technology-hackathon-2015.devpost.com/) and was one of the two winners for best collaboration and opensource development. The project started by: [Chris](https://github.com/chriswmackey), [Keith](https://github.com/alfarok), [Matthew](https://github.com/mdahlhausen) and [Mostapha](https://github.com/mostapharoudsari). You can read the full story [here](https://github.com/HydraShare/hydra#hydra).

### This repository only contains [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.com) node for Hydra. [Read here to learn how to use the node to create Hydras](https://github.com/HydraShare/hydra/wiki).

## Don't share files, share Hydras!
